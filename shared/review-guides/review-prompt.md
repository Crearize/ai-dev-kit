## Common Steps (All Areas)

### Step 1: Check Previous Reviews (Prevent Duplicate Feedback)

**Critical: To avoid repeating already-addressed issues:**

1. Check all previous review comments on this PR
2. Do not re-raise items already marked as resolved
3. Only review new changes or unaddressed items
4. For synchronize events (additional pushes), focus on diff since last review

### Step 2: Understand Changes

Review the changed files and understand:
- Intent of changes (new feature, bug fix, refactoring, etc.)
- Impact scope (which modules/layers affected)
- Related existing implementations

### Step 3: Area-Specific Review

Read the relevant area review file and follow its instructions.

### Step 4: Self-Verification (Before Output)

**Before outputting review results, verify:**

1. **Evidence**: Does each finding reference specific conventions or documentation?
2. **Fact-check**: Is the issue actually present in the code? No speculation?
3. **Duplicate check**: Not repeating existing PR comments?
4. **Priority check**: Are "must-fix" items truly bugs, security issues, or rule violations?
5. **Specificity**: Do all "must-fix" items include concrete code examples?
6. **Side effects**: Could proposed fixes affect other functionality?
