## Development with Claude Code

This project uses the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skill system. We recommend using **Claude Code** for development, which can leverage the skills defined in `skills/` for structured workflows:

- `/brainstorming` — Explore requirements and design before implementation
- `/writing-plans` — Create implementation plans before writing code
- `/quality-check` — Run quality checks before pushing

## Pull Request Process

1. **Do not push directly to `main`** — Always create a feature branch
2. **Branch naming**: `[type]/[description]-[issue-number]` (e.g., `feat/add-python-stack-42`)
3. **Create a Pull Request** — PRs require at least **1 reviewer approval** before merging
4. **Stale reviews are automatically dismissed** — If you push new commits after receiving approval, the review resets
